This project is a YouTube GPT Creator that generates YouTube video titles, scripts (potentially descriptions, tags, thumbnails) based on a given prompt. It utilizes the Langchain library, which is a powerful language model chaining framework.

## About 
Langchain is a framework that simplifies working with language models and enables creating complex conversational systems. It allows chaining together multiple language models, incorporating memories, and handling prompt templates effortlessly.

This project is mainly based off Nicolas Renotte's code. Visit his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjeijApQ06s7uH9vUT_d6Ww) and check out his insightful content on AI and NLP.

## How to Use

1. Plug in your prompt in the input field provided.
2. The program generates a YouTube video title based on the prompt using the Langchain framework.
3. Wikipedia research is performed based on the prompt.
4. Using the generated title and Wikipedia research, a YouTube video script is generated.
5. The program displays the generated title and script on the screen.
6. The program also provides historical data for the title and script generation process.

Feel free to explore different prompts and utilize the power of Langchain to generate engaging YouTube content effortlessly!
For a detailed explanation of the code and implementation, refer to the code documentation and the Langchain library documentation.

**Disclaimer**: This project is a demonstration of the capabilities of the Langchain framework and is not a fully functional production-ready application.
